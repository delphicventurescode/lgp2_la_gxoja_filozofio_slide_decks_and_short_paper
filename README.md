# La Gxoja Projekto ‚Äî Slide Decks & Papers

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **La Gxoja Projekto**, a bold and creative initiative aimed at reimagining human flourishing through the lenses of philosophy, history, and practical action.

## üéì What Is *La Gxoja Filozofio*?

*La Gxoja Filozofio* (Esperanto for *The Joy Philosophy*) is a modern, life-affirming worldview that blends ancient insight with contemporary research in positive psychology. Rooted in the global human search for happiness, this philosophy seeks to serve as an alternative to Stoicism, Existentialism, and Nihilism‚Äîoffering practical tools, emotional clarity, and a renewed ethical compass for living well.

The accompanying materials form an introduction to the key principles, comparisons with other major philosophies, and the real-world practices (known as CHEATs ‚Äì Comprehensive Happiness Enhancing Activities and Tasks) that form the backbone of this joyful approach.

I also have developed chatbots, so that people can actually try out the La Gxoja Filozofio in a practical way. I have a GitHub repo where I have samples of chats with my chatbot wherein I was discussing my emails with Professors Wendy Doniger (U. Chicago, South Asian Studies), Michael Witzel (Harvard, South Asian Studies), Al Roth (Stanford, Economics, Nobel Laureate), Sonja Lyubomirsky (UC Riverside), and many other fine researchers. The chatbot can help compose professional and respectful emails, and even make the whole process of sending emails feel utterly joyful. It can even make the task of calling a bank to close down an account feel joyful. From the highly interesting to the highly mundane, the chatbot makes you reorient your thinking in new ways that I personally have not seen anywhere else.

Note to the reader: always read the latest version of each paper, slide deck or other material in each directory, in case there are multiple versions.

## üåç Why This Matters

We live in an age of anxiety, burnout, and alienation. *La Gxoja Projekto* is an attempt to carve a different path‚Äîone that places *joy* at the heart of personal development, community building, and intellectual life. This isn‚Äôt a rejection of the past, but a remix: informed by tradition, enriched by science, and carried forward by creativity.

## üìú More from La Gxoja Projekto

In addition to *La Gxoja Filozofio*, I have also developed a new interpretive lens on South Asian history called *La Gxoja Historio*‚Äîa retelling that centers joy, pluralism, and intellectual curiosity as guiding themes through the complex and often turbulent narratives of the region. Rather than focusing solely on conquest or suffering, this perspective seeks to highlight moments of synthesis, creativity, and resilience across time.

I have also proposed a new *Theory of the Firm*, rooted in classical economic insights. This theory is a rival to other theories of the firm such as those by Ronald Coase and Oliver Williamson. If you're curious to learn more about either of these explorations, please feel free to reach out.
