# La Gxoja Projekto ‚Äî Slide Decks & Papers

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **La Gxoja Projekto**, a bold and creative initiative aimed at reimagining human flourishing through the lenses of philosophy, history, and practical action.

## üéì What Is *La Gxoja Filozofio*?

*La Gxoja Filozofio* (Esperanto for *The Joy Philosophy*) is a modern, life-affirming worldview that blends ancient insight with contemporary research in positive psychology. Rooted in the global human search for happiness, this philosophy seeks to serve as an alternative to Stoicism, Existentialism, and Nihilism‚Äîoffering practical tools, emotional clarity, and a renewed ethical compass for living well.

The accompanying materials form an introduction to the key principles, comparisons with other major philosophies, and the real-world practices (known as CHEATs ‚Äì Comprehensive Happiness Enhancing Activities and Tasks) that form the backbone of this joyful approach.

I also have developed chatbots, so that people can actually try out the La Gxoja Filozofio in a practical way. I have samples of chats with my chatbot wherein I was discussing my emails with Professors Wendy Doniger (U. Chicago, South Asian Studies), Michael Witzel (Harvard, South Asian Studies), Al Roth (Stanford, Economics, Nobel Laureate), Sonja Lyubomirsky, and many other fine researchers.

Always read the latest version of each paper, slide deck or other material in each directory.

## üåç Why This Matters

We live in an age of anxiety, burnout, and alienation. *La Gxoja Projekto* is an attempt to carve a different path‚Äîone that places *joy* at the heart of personal development, community building, and intellectual life. This isn‚Äôt a rejection of the past, but a remix: informed by tradition, enriched by science, and carried forward by creativity.

## üì¨ Get Involved

If you find these ideas resonant, challenging, or even joyfully absurd, feel free to reach out, open issues, or start a conversation. This is a living project‚Äîand there‚Äôs room for you in it.
